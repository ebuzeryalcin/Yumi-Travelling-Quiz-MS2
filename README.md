# Yumi Travelling Quiz

My project is a quiz for people who love to travel. Travelling to different destinations can be at point but sometimes you can also be disappointed maybe because you did not
think about if the travel destination have things that matches your personality. 

Therefore, at the beginning of the Quiz the page is asking you "WHAT TYPE OF TRAVELLER ARE YOU?" which really asks logical questions to decide whether you are a nature lover
or a city lover. I think that the most important thing to figure out before you even start planning a trip is what kind of traveler person you are, what do you enjoy. 
If you plan a trip that doesnâ€™t fit your personality the trip can mostly be bad. You need to know who you are. 

By asking some questions that maybe do not come in mind in this quiz maybe you can consider few things before booking your next vacation. By starting the quiz I aim to get 
peoples attention to start thinking how their every day life is. Maybe to make users think about their daily environment, what they like and unlike about it. So they can start 
to reflect what travel destination would make them happy and maybe suit their feelings about travel at the same time they are trying the quiz. Some people stick to nature 
destionations, some prefer to discover cities, and some people like to discover a different type of vacation than what they are used to do.

So by going through the quiz and choosing answers, users will get a score which shows whether they are a nature lover or a city lover. And depending on the score the result
page will also show travel recommendations viewed on google maps. 

The website have three pages with simple and intuitive layout. By clicking on Start Quiz button on the first page you are redirected the quiz page to use the actual quiz.
When you have finished the quiz the page redirects you to the result page where depending on your score the website returns what type of traveller you are. 

The website also utilise an google maps API to recommend travel locations on the map which changes depending on score. 

If the quiz have not been finished the result page will not show any score and will not show locations on the map.

This website is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. This is the website, [Yumi Travelling Quiz](https://ebuzeryalcin.github.io/Yumi-Travelling-Quiz-MS2/).
